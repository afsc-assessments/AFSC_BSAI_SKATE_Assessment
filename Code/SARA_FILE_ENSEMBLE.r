    ## MFR - Enter multiplier for recruitment data, N at age, and survey number (1,1000,1000000): 
    ## CID - CATCH_INPUT_DATA - Categorical level of catch input data used in the assessment model accepted for use in management, as described in Appendix A of the 2018 Next Gen SAIP document, see lookup table (options: 0 - None, 1 - Major gaps preclude use, 2 - Major gaps in some sectors(s), 3 - Minor gaps across sectors, 4 - Minor gaps in some sector(s), 5 - Near complete knowledge)
    ## AID - ABUNDANCE_INPUT_DATA - Categorical level of abundance input data used in the assessment model accepted for use in management, as described in Appendix A of the 2018 Next Gen SAIP document, see lookup table (options: 0 - None, 1 - Uncertain or expert opinion, 2 - Standardized fishery-dependent, 3 - Limited fishery-independent, 4 - Comprehensive fishery-independent, 5 - Absolute abundance):
    ## BID - BIOLOGICAL_INPUT_DATA - Categorical level of biological or life history input data used in the assessment model accepted for use in management, as described in Appendix A of the 2018 Next Gen SAIP document, see lookup table (options: 0 - None, 1 - Proxy-based, 2 - Empirical and proxy-based, 3 - Mostly empirical estimates, 4 - Track changes over time, 5 - Comprehensive over time and space):
    ## SCID - SIZEAGE_COMP_INPUT_DATA - Categorical level of size or age composition input data used in the assessment model accepted for use in management, as described in Appendix A of the 2018 Next Gen SAIP document, see lookup table (options: 0 - None, 1 - Major gaps preclude use, 2 - Suport data-limited only, 3 - Gaps, bus supports age-structured assessment, 4 - Support fishery composition, 5 - Very complete):
    ## EL - ECOSYSTEM LINKAGE - Categorical level of ecosystem linkage used in the assessment model accepted for use in management, as described in Appendix A of the 2018 Next Gen SAIP document, see lookup table (options: 0 - None, 1 - Informative or used to process input data, 2 - Random variation, not mechanistic, 3 - Direct linkages(s), 4 - Linkage(s) informed by process studies, 5 - Fully coupled):
    ## F_LIMIT - Fishing mortality rate or total catch threshold, above which the stock is considered to be overfishing. NOTE: For Tiers 1-3 during a full or operational assessment this is the reverse engineered F from this year's accepted model that would have produced a catch for last year equal to last yearâ€™s OFL. For Tiers 1-3 during a partial assessment this is FMSY. For Tiers 4-5, single stock assessment, this is the estimate of M. For Tiers 4-5 stock complex assessments or Tier 6, this is sum of the OFL in tons for the stocks in the complex.):
