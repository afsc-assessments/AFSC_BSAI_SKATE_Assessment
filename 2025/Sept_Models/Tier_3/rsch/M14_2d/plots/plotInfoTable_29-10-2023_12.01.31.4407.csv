"SPR4_phase.png","Phase plot of biomass ratio vs. SPR ratio.<br> Each point represents the biomass ratio at the start of the year and the relative fishing intensity in that same year. Warmer colors (red) represent early years and colder colors (blue) represent recent years. Lines through the final point show 95% intervals based on the asymptotic uncertainty for each dimension. The shaded ellipse is a 95% region which accounts for the estimated correlation between the two quantities: -0.433. The vertical line at 0.35 indicates the reference point as defined in the forecast.ss which can be removed from the plot via <code>SS_plots(..., btarg = -1)</code>.
